### Description:
This project is intended to teach me the basics of PHP.  In order to gain a better understanding of PHP, I will implement a password generator using the xkcd style and methodology. More information about the XKCD Password Method can be found here: <https://xkcd.com/936/>

### Demo Information:
I plan to do an in person demo in my Section after Thursday's lecture in front of my group and TA Dan.

### Additional Information:
+ Coded to HTML5 standards and uses the <http://validator.w3.org/> service to check it.
+ No Login is required.
+ Did a `cat common-english-words.txt | tr "," "\n" > wordlist` to make it easier to parse in PHP.
+ My special characters word list is also loaded from a file called speciallist in the dictionary directory.

### Plugins and Outside Code used Credits:
+ CSS Reset -  <http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/> v2.0, 20110126 License: none (public domain)
